A Chrome extension to blacklist URLs from entering Chrome's history.

# Usage:

- Once extension is loaded, click on the "Options" selection and add your desired domain name (example.com)
- To overwrite the buffers for "recently closed", go to "Options" and click "Open History". This opens up 10 history tabs and closes them to overwrite the last 10 records.
